Security & Performance via static website publishing. One plugin to solve WordPress's biggest problems.

== Description ==

Security & Performance via static website publishing. One plugin to solve WordPress's biggest problems.

Keep using WordPress for what it's best at - managing content, but remove the security and performance headaches by publishing the site as static HTML.

A static site closes all the doors that an out of date WordPress, theme or plugin can leave open.

A pre-generated static site will outperform caching plugins, allowing you to serve at local speeds to users around the world.

[**https://wp2static.com**](https://wp2static.com/)

Not compatible with WooCommerce or membership sites, but solutions like [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com) allow for eCommerce on static websites.

= Features =

 * publishes a standalone, static html copy of your whole WordPress website
 * removes tell-tale signs your site is running WordPress, making it unattractive to hackers
 * auto-deploy to a folder on your server, a ZIP file, FTP server, S3, GitHub, Netlif, BunnyCDN, BitBucket or GitLab
 * schedule unattended exports via the WP Crontrol plugin or by hitting the custom hook
 * desktop notifications alert you to when exports are complete


= Benefits =

 * protects you from malicious attacks/malware
 * speeds up your site by not hitting the database or executing any PHP code
 * allows you to host your site for free on GitHub Pages, Netlify or the free tier of AWS S3, Azure, etc
 * allows you to deploy to crazy fast hosting options, like S3, behind CloudFront
 * have a nice development -> staging -> production workflow and integrate with your CI tools

= A word from the author =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPc4JjBvkrU]

= Who loves this? =

 - Digital Agencies with many sites to manage, no need to worry about WP/plugin updates for client sites
 - Internet Marketers can create a bunch of quick sites/landing pages that load fast and are free to host
 - Solo website owners and content creators who like WordPress but don't want to worry about how to secure it
 - Operations people at large corporations don't often like dealing with WordPress, this allows them to close the security holes and have more control over the hosting
 - Budget conscious people like free hosting (who doesn't?!?)
 - Government agencies who have strict security requirements, but have users who prefer to use WordPress
 * Thos who want to use it to archive an old WordPress website, keeping the content online, but not worrying about keeping WP up to date

This plugin produces a static HTML version of your wordpress install, incredibly useful for anyone who would like the publishing power of wordpress but whose webhost doesn't allow dynamic PHP driven sites - such as GitHub Pages. You can run your development site on a different domain or offline, and the plugin will change all relevant URLs when you publish your site. It's a simple but powerful plugin, and after hitting the publish button, the plugin will output a ZIP file of your entire site, ready to upload straight to it's new home.


= Getting started =

Here is the basic premise:

You need 2 URLs of some sort (they can be on the same server, different servers, subdomains, etc).

 - 1st URL is for where you keep WP - this doesn't need to be accessible or known to anyone but you, if you're the only one working on your content

 - 2nd URL is where you'll "publish" the static version of your site to. This is likely to be your main domain (ie, http://mywordpresssite.com).

That said, you can install the plugin and do an easy test without any other configuration. This will publish a static version to a subdirectory, such as http://mywordpresssite.com/mystatictest/. That's a good way to check the static site is publishing properly, then you can switch to another deployment option, such as FTP or GitHub Pages and deploy to your live site.

As WordPress allows infinite customization and configurations, I don't think any plugin author would be willing to guarantee complete compatibility with every theme, plugin and custom coding on every site. But my aim is to get as high a % of people as possible able to take advantage of static hosting with their WP site.

If you haven't read on why you may want to host statically, please have a read of this article:

Developed by [**Leon Stafford**](http://leonstafford.github.io). If you have any questions about this plugin's usage, installation or development, please email me at: [help@wp2static.com](mailto:help@wp2static.com)

== Installation ==

= via WP Admin panel =

1. Go to Plugins > Add New
2. Search for "WP2Static"
3. Click on the Install Now button
4. Activate the plugin and find it under the Tools menu

[Watch  an installation video](https://youtu.be/kTYlohYGmBk)

= manual installation =

1. Upload the static-html-output directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Access the plugin settings from the "Tools" menu

= via WP CLI =

1. `wp --allow-root plugin install static-html-output-plugin --activate`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure all the options? =

There's some useful information on the page once you select a deployment method. There are also some good tutorials linked at https://wp2static.com/

= Where can I publish my static site to? =

Anywhere that allows HTML files to be uploaded, ie:

 * Any FTP server
 * GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket Pages (GitHub API integration now included)
 * S3 / CloudFront
 * Netlify
 * BunnyCDN
 * Rackspace Cloud Files

= My export failed - how do I proceed? =

Everyone's WordPress hosting environment and configuration is unique, with different plugins, themes, PHP versions, to name a few. Whilst the plugin does its best to support all environments, sometimes you'll encounter a new issue. Sometimes we can adjust the settings in the plugin to overcome an issue, other times, it will require a bugfix and a new release of the plugin (usually a quick process).

When you have an issue, send the contents of your "Export Log" on the plugin screen to the developer, at [help@wp2static.com](mailto:help@wp2static.com). He'll usually respond within 12 hrs, often sooner.

Thanks to a user donation for funding the development work to get GitHub Pages exporting added as a new feature.

Though this is no longer an officially supported PHP version, many of this plugin's users are running PHP 5.3 or earlier.

If you are one of these affected users, please now upgrade and enjoy all the new useful features!

Finally, I couldn't make a new release without fixing the Dropbox export functionality - unbeknowst to me, they had killed version 1 of their API in September, breaking the functionality in this plugin, along with many other apps. 

Please contact me to report any bugs or request new features. Thanks again for your support of this plugin!

= 1.9 =

Critical update for many users~!

 * Bugfix: Plugin now works on PHP 5.3

Though this is no longer an officially supported PHP version, many of this plugin's users are running PHP 5.3 or earlier. This fix should once again allow them to use the plugin, which has not been possible for them since about version 1.2. If you are one of these affected users, please now upgrade and enjoy all the new useful features!

= 1.8 =

 * Bugfix: improved URL rewriting

Plugin now ensures that formatted versions of your site's URL, ie //mydomain.com or http:\/\/mydomain.com\/ or the https/http equivalent are detected and rewritten to your target Base URL. The rewriting should now also work within CSS and JavaScript files.

From this update on, will only do major point increases, ie 1.3, 1.4, vs 1.3.1, 1.3.2. This is due to way WP plugin directory only reports usage stats across major version numbers.
